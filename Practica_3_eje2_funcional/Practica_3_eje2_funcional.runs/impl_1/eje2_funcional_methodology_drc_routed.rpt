2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell CUV_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) CUV_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell CUV_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) CUV_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell DOV_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) DOV_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell DOV_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) DIV_reg/CLR, DOV_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#5 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell SEV_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) SEV_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch CUV_reg/L7 (in CUV_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin CUV_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch DIV_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin DIV_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch DOV_reg/L7 (in DOV_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin DOV_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch SEV_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin SEV_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 4 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
